# Android Project 4A

Here is a simple Android project, used for discovery of Kotlin and a few (mobile) programmation principles.

## Topics covered

During this project, we covered the followings :
  * Kotlin basics
  * MVVM
  * Clean architecture
  * Koin
  * Room for databases.

For the moment, I did not complete the project, I got stuck on the Room part, and was not able to debug it.
After following the video playlist, my test Users were not created and I couldn't find out why. 
I am considering finishing it soon as it is an interesting topic.

So far, the parts that are missing are :
  * User creation (I already have it but it is not working properly)
  * Login page
  * Unit tests
